# Selector in CSS
---
CSS selector are used to **find(or select)** the HTML elements you want to style.

##### We can divide CSS selector into seven categories:
- **Simple Selector:** Select element based on tag, id, class.
- **Attribute Selector:** Select elements based on an attribute or attribute value.
- **Combinator Selector:** Select element based on a specific relationship between them.
- **Pseudo-class Selector:** Select elements based on certain state.
- **Pseudo-elements Selector:** Select and style a part of an element.
- **Universal Selector:** Select whole html. Generally it is use for add margin and padding 0px.
- **Group Selector:** Select multiple element.
### Simple Selector:
---
#### Tag Selector:
---
For select a tag and apply style on the the tag you have to write the tag name and then we have to add curly braces. Between these curly braces we have to write all code. An example are given bellow for clear understanding.

```css
h1{
	color: tomato;
}
```

#### Class Selector:
---
If you want make a design for multiple element then you can use this class on that element where you have need. For select class in CSS you have to add  `.` sign before class name. An example are given bellow:

```css
.heading_red{
	color: red;
}
```

#### ID Selector: 
---
For select Id we have add  `#` sign before Id name in CSS. An example are given bellow:
```css
#input_name{
	font-size: 1rem;
}
```


## Attribute Selectors:

##### CSS [attribute] Selector:
---
It is possible to style HTML elements that have specific attributes or attribute values.
The `[attribute]` selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.

The following example selects all `<a>` elements with a `target` attribute:

```css
a[target] {
	background-color: yellow;
}
```

##### CSS `[attribute="value"]` Selector:
---
The `[attribute="value"]` selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute and value.

The following example selects all  `<a>` elements with a `target="_blank" ` attribute:

```css
a[target="_blank"] {
	background-color: yellow;
}
```
##### CSS [attribute~="value"] Selector:
---
The `[attribute~="value"]` selector is used to select elements with an attribute value containing a specified word.

The following example selects all elements with a title attribute that contains a space-separated list of words, one of which is `"flower"`:

```css
[title~="flower"] {
	border: 5px solid yellow;
}
```

## Combinator Selector:
---
A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.

There are four different combinators in CSS:

- descendant selector (space)
- child selector (>)
- adjacent sibling selector (+)
- general sibling selector (~)

##### Descendant Selector:
---

The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

The following example selects all `<p>` elements inside `<div>` elements:

```css
div p {  
	background-color: yellow;
}
```

This select all `Paragraph` which descendant of `div`.

##### Child Selector (>):
---

The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

The following example selects all `<p>` elements that are children of a  `<div>` element:

```css
div > p {
	background-color: yellow;
}
```
This select all child of `div` container.

###### Difference between Descendant and Child Selector:
---

I know  now you are thinking about the different between Descendant Selector and Child Selector. Now I will show you two codes  and output which will helps you to understand difference between Descendant Selector and Child Selector.

###### Code:
###### `HTML`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">

<head>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <title>Document</title>

</head>

<body>

    <div>

        <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>

        <p>This is another paragraph inside a div.</p>

        <h1>

            <p>This is a paragraph inside Heading.</p>

        </h1>

    </div>

</body>

</html>
```

###### `CSS`:
```css
div p{

    color: rgb(255, 56, 56);

}
```

##### OUTPUT:

![[descendant_selector.png]]


###### Code:
###### `HTML`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">

<head>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <title>Document</title>

</head>

<body>

    <div>

        <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>

        <p>This is another paragraph inside a div.</p>

        <h1>

            <p>This is a paragraph inside Heading.</p>

        </h1>

    </div>

</body>

</html>
```

###### `CSS`:
```css
div > p{

    color: rgb(255, 56, 56);

}
```
##### OUTPUT:

![[child_selector.png]]

Here we can see, for Descendant Selector the paragraph which is under the heading are changed for CSS. Because though that paragraph are not directly child of div but this is descendant of div. That's why the style are applied. On the other hand the last paragraph are not are child of div. That's why in child selector the last paragraph are not selected. I think the difference you can understand.


##### Adjacent Sibling Selector (+):
---

The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element. Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following". The following example selects the first `<p>` element that are placed immediately after `<div>` elements:

###### Code:
###### `HTML`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">

<head>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <title>Document</title>

</head>

<body>

   <div>

        <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>

    </div>

    <p>This is another paragraph inside a div.</p>

  

    <p>This is a paragraph inside Heading.</p>

</body>

</html>
```

###### `CSS`:
```css
div + p{

    color: rgb(255, 56, 56);

}
```
##### OUTPUT:
![[adjacent_selector.png]]

Here you can see those paragraph has after closing div that are styled for the CSS rules. Adjacent sibling selector are work in this method.

## General Sibling Selector (~):
---
The general sibling selector (~) selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.

```css
div ~ p {
	background-color: yellow;
}
```
This will select all `paragraph` element which are after closing the div. An example are given bellow:

###### Code:
---
```css
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div ~ p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p>Paragraph 1.</p>

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 2.</p>
</div>

<p>Paragraph 3.</p>
<code>Some code.</code>
<p>Paragraph 4.</p>

</body>
</html>



```
###### OUTPUT:
---

## Pseudo-classes Selector:
---
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

- Style an element when a user mouses over it
- Style visited and unvisited links differently
- Style an element when it gets focus

#### Syntax

The syntax of pseudo-classes:

```css
selector:pseudo-class {  
	property: value;
}
```

There has different type of Pseudo class element. Like `link`, `visited`, `hover`,`active`.

### Pseudo Elements:
---

}
```

If we want to change the color and font size of first line we can add the CSS bellow:

## Universal Selector:
---
Universal Selector is use for select all element. The mostly common use case are it want to set margin and padding 0 for window the we can write the code bellow.
```css
*{
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
}
```

## Group Selector:
---
Group selector is a selector where we select many element for same design. In many case we have to add same design for different element. In most of the case when we design many element using Id then we have to use same design for different Id. In this case we can use Group Selector. An example of Group selector are given bellow:

```css
#w3r p, h1 h2 h3 { 
	color: darkred; 
	font-variant: small-caps; 
}
```
