We can also add custom font on our website. Thats why we have to link the font into head tag the we can add the font in CSS file. We can get the fonts form Google font. An example are given bellow:

**HTML**

```html
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Sofia">
<style>
body{
font-family:"Sofia", sans-serif; 
}
</style>
</head>
```


#### Font Fallback:
---
However there are no 100% completely web safe fonts. There is alawy a chanch that a font is not found or is not installed properly. Therefor we have to use fallback font. Fallback font is used to display text when the primary font is not available. This can happen for a variety of reasons such as:
-  The primary font is not installed on this user's computer.
- The primary font is not loaded yet.
- The primary font is missing.

The rule of fallback font are given bellow:
```css
body{
  font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
}
```

### Font Style
---
The `font-style` property are mostly used for specify the text will normal or italic or oblique. Oblique are very similer to the italic. Those which font are not support then we can use oblique on that font.
```css
p{
  font-style: italic;
}
```

### Font Weight:
---
The font weight property are specifies the weight of a font. We can make a text bolt using `font-weight` property. We can also use 100-900 value at the position `font-weight` value
```css
h1{
  font-weight: bold;
}

p{
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

### Font Size:
---
The `font-size` property used to set the size of the text. We can use different type of unit to set font size like em, rem, px ect.
```css
h1{
  font-size: 32px;
}
p{
  font-size: 1rem;
}
span{
  font-size: .5em /*8px/16=.5em*/
}
```

### Font Variant
------
The `font-variant` property specifies whether or not a text should be displayed in a small-caps font.In a small-caps font, all lowercase letters are converted to uppercase letters. However, the converted uppercase letters appears in a smaller font size than the original uppercase letters in the text.

```css
p.normal {  font-variant: normal;}  
  
p.small {  font-variant: small-caps;}
```

### Font Shorthand:
---
The full shorthand of font is `font: font-style font-variant font-weight font-size/line-height font-family`.
```css
p{
  font: italic small-caps bold 1rem Arial;
}
```
