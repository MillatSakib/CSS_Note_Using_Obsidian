There are different type of value for display property. Like `flex`, `grid`, `block`, `inline-block`, `inline`
But here will not discouse about `flex` and `grid`. Because there has a vast topic for discouse. 

**Block Element**: Which element are take the whole space of a line or take a newline automatically are called block element. Like 
- `<div>`
- `<h1>`
- `<p>`
- `<form>`
- `<header>`
- `<footer>`
- `section>`

**Inline Element:** An inline element does not take a new line and only takes the space as it need. Some inline element are given bellow:
- `<span>`
- `<a>`
- `<img>`
**Inline Block Element:** The limitation of inline element are if we we use margin and padding that does not work perfectly and if add border after adding margin and padding there cause overlaping. For solving this problem we use inline block element. An example are given bellow for clear understanding.

```html
<html>
<head>
<style>
#test1 {
display: inline;
padding: 40px;
border: 2px solid black;
}
#test2 {
display: inline;
padding: 20px;
border: 2px solid black;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<span id="test1">This is span 1</span> <br><span id="test2">This is span 2</span>
</body>
</html>
```
###### Output:
--- 
![[inline.png]]

But if we change `inlne` into `inline-block` then all problem are solved and it looks like bellow :
![[inline-block.png]]

#### `display:none` rule
---
If we want to remove a block of code will not show output then we can use `display: none` property. And we can change it using javascript for condition. 
```css
div#removeDiv{
  display: none;
}
```
