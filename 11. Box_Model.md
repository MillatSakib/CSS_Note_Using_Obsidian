When a browser rendering a HTML document then the engine represents each element as a rectangular box according to the standard CSS basic box model. CSS determines the size, position and properties(color, background, border size, etc.) of these boxes.Every box has four parts or areas that define by their respective edges. Like
- Content Edge

### Content Area
---
The content area are bounded by the content edge, contains the real content of the element, such as text, an image or video. Its dimensions are the content width and content height. It often has a background color or background image. If the `box-sizing` property are `content-box` and if the element is block element, the content area's size can be explicitly defined with the `width`, `min-width`, `height`, `min-height`, `max-width` and `max-height`

### Padding area:
---
The padding are bounded by the padding edge and extend the content area inside border. We can set the padding space using `padding` element.

### Border area:
---
If we use border in the element then the border area take space between margin and padding. The thickness of the border are determined by the `border-width` or using shorthand `border`.

### Margin area:
---
The margin area bounded by the margin edge and extends the border area to include an empty area outside the border. We can add margin using the `margin` shorthand.
