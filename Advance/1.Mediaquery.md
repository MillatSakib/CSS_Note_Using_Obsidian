The CSS Media Queries are a feature of CSS3 that allow HTML content to adapt to a device type, such as print or screen, or specific characteristics and parameters, such as the screen resolution or viewport.There are lots of other things we can target beside viewport width. That might be screen resolution, device orientation, operating system preference, or even more among a whole bevy of things we can query and use to style content.

For make a responsive web design we must have to use `Media Query`. We can control the element for the value of screen resolution or we can control the element for print. If we want to control the design for screen the code will like bellow:

```css
@media only screen{
    body{
        color: rgb(0, 47, 255);
    }
}
```

If we want to contorl the print element we have to use `only print` inside the Media Query. An example are given bellwo:

```css
@media only print{
    body{
        color: rgb(0, 47, 255);
    }
}
```

And if we want all the `media query` CSS apply in the screen and print then you can use the `all` instead of `print` or `screen`.

```css
@media all{
    body #responsive{
        color: rgb(0, 47, 255);
    }
}
```

There are three portion on `media query`. They are
- Media type.
- Media Feature.
- CSS Rules.
An example of picture are given bellwo:

`Media type:` In CSS media queries, media types define the broad category of device or output medium for which the query applies. They are optional, but when included, they specify the context in which the media features within the query should be evaluated.


**Common Media Types:**

- **screen:** Applies to most screen-based devices like computers, tablets, and smartphones.
- **print:** Targets printed output, often used to adjust styles for print media.
- **speech:** Addresses speech synthesis devices, commonly used for screen readers.
- **all:** Applies to all devices and is the default if no media type is specified.
### Media Feature
This part of a media query allows you to describe different features of a device, such as width, aspect-ratio or color. Most email developers rely on the following options:

- `max-width` and `min-width`
- `max-device-width` and `min-device-width`
- `device-pixel-ratio`
- `prefers-color-scheme`



We can also use `media query` into HTML document. An example are given bellwo:

```css
<html>
<head>
    <!-- Served to all users -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="all.css" media="all" /> <!-- Served to screens that are at least 20em wide -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="small.css" media="(min-width: 20em)" />
    <!-- Served to screens that are at least 64em wide -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="medium.css" media="(min-width: 64em)" />
    <!-- Served to screens that are at least 90em wide -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="large.css" media="(min-width: 90em)" />
    <!-- Served to screens that are at least 120em wide -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="extra-large.css" media="(min-width: 120em)" />
    <!-- Served to print media, like printers -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="print.css" media="print" />
</head> <!-- ... -->
</html>

```

In CSS media query we can use logical operator like only, and, or, not. 

- **`only` Operator:** `only` operator are use to improving compatibitily with older browsers. The `only` keyword prevents older browser which don't support  media query with media features from applying the given styles. It has no effect on modern browsers.

```css
@media only screen and (color) {
  /* … */
}
```


- **`and` Operator:** The `and` keyword are used to make an and logic. It combines multiple media feature or a media type with media features within a single media query. `and` keyword ensures all specified condition are met before applying the styles.

Syntax:

```css
@media media_type and media_type and (media_feature_1: value) and (media_feature_2: value) {
  /* Styles to apply if all conditions are true */
}

```

Example:

```css
@media screen and print and (min-width: 768px) and (orientation: landscape) {
  /* Styles for landscape screens with a minimum width of 768px */
}
```

- **`comma(,) or` Operator:** comma are use to give a or operator. And you know if one of the logic are true the code block are execute in or logic. This comma are working in same way. Like a code are given bellow:
```css
@media (max-width: 480px), (min-width: 900px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
```

Here if the screen resolution are less then 480px or greater then 900px then the background color of body will lightblue. This is the use case of comma.

**`not` Operator:** Not operator are usingto inverts the meaning of media query. we should not media query at last. If we use and then the not are apply on the whole resultant. An example are given bellow:

If our code is:
```css
@media not all and (monochrome) {
  /* … */
}

```

The media query will evaluate it like this:
```css
@media not (all and (monochrome)) {
  /* … */
}

```

The media query will not evaluate like this:

```css
@media (not all) and (monochrome) {
  /* … */
}

```

On the case of `or` logic 
If our code is :

```css
@media not screen and (color), print and (color) {
  /* … */
}

```

It will evaluate like this:

```css
@media (not (screen and (color))), print and (color) {
  /* … */
}

```
