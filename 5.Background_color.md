The CSS background properties are used to add background effects for elements. Here we will know about
- background-color
- background-image
- background-repeat
- background-attachment
- background-position
- background-size
- background (shorthand)

###### `backgorund-color`:
---
The `background-color` property specifies the background color of an element.

```css
body{
	background-color: red;
}
```

###### `backgorund-image`:
---
We can add an image in background using `background-image` CSS property.

```css
body{
	background-image: url("/css.png");
}
```

But here background image will repeat. To stop repeating we have to use `background-repeat` property. We can set the background repeat in x-axis or y-axis or using no-repeat.

For repeating along x-axis we have to write the code bellow:

```css

	background-image: url("gradiant_bg.png");
	background-repeat: repeat-x;
}

```

For repeating along y-axis we have to write the code bellow:

```css
body{
	background-image: url("gradiant_bg.png");
	background-repeat: repeat-y;
}
```

 If you want no repeat the background image, write the code bellow:

```css
body{
	background-image: url("gradiant_bg.png");
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

If you don't want to scroll your background image then you can use `background-attachment: fixed` property. An example are given bellow for clear understand:
```css
body{
	background-image: url("gradiant_bg.png");
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-size: cover;
	background-position: center;
	background-attachment: fixed;
}
```
You can also use `background-attachment: scroll` if you want to scroll the background.

Here you can see I also use two more property. That are `backgroudn-size:cover` & `background-position:center` Here using `background-size: cover` I make the background are take total space of window. And using `background-position: center` I align the image into center of window.


### Background Shorthand:
---
The full sequence of the background shorthand property in CSS is:

```css
background: <background-color> <background-image> <background-repeat> <background-attachment> <background-position> / <background-size> <background-origin> <background-clip>;

```

Each property value is separated by at least one space. When specifying a `background-size` value, it must immediately follow the `background-position` value. Additionally, the `background-position` and `background-size` must have a slash (/) in between them (e.g., `background-position: top 50% / 100% auto;`).

**`background-origin`**

The `background-origin` property specifies the reference box that the background image is positioned relative to. This property affects how the background image is positioned when the element has padding or a border.

**Values:**

- `border-box`: The background image is positioned relative to the border box of the element. This is the default value.
- `padding-box`: The background image is positioned relative to the padding box of the element.
- `content-box`: The background image is positioned relative to the content box of the element.

```css
.element {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  background-image: url("landscape.jpg");
  background-origin: padding-box;
}

```

In this example, the background image will be positioned relative to the padding box of the element. This means that the image will be positioned 10px from the top and left edges of the element, because the element has 10px of padding.

**`background-clip`**

The `background-clip` property determines how the background image is clipped to the element's boundaries. This property can be used to prevent the background image from bleeding outside of the element's edges.

**Values:**

- `border-box`: The background image is clipped to the border box of the element. This is the default value.
- `padding-box`: The background image is clipped to the padding box of the element.
- `content-box`: The background image is clipped to the content box of the element.

```css
.element {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  background-image: url("landscape.jpg");
  background-clip: padding-box;
}

```

In this example, the background image will be clipped to the padding box of the element. This means that the image will not bleed outside of the element's edges, even though the element has a border.
