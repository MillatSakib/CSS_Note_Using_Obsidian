The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element. There are five type of position property in CSS. 
- `static`
- `relative`
- `absolute`
- `fixed`
- `sticky`

### Static:
---
All the HTML element are static by default. Static positioned element are not affected by the top, bottom, left & right properties. But use the static property are not good practice if we don't define the position property of all child element.
An example are given bellow..
```css
div.static{
  position: static;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
```

### Relative:
---
An element with `position: relative;` is positioned relative to its normal position. We can use setting top, right, bottom, left in relative position. Here I give a  CSS coide of relative position.

```css
div.relative{
  position: relative;
  left: 30px;
  border: 3px solid black;
}
```

### Absolute:
---
The absolute position are depending on parent element. We have to use relative position on parent element if we want use absolute position. We can use left, right, top or bottom. An example are given bellow:
###### Code:

```css
div.relative {  
  position: relative;  
  width: 400px;  
  height: 200px;  
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}  
  
div.absolute {  
  position: absolute;  
  top: 80px;  
  right: 0;  
  width: 200px;  
  height: 100px;  
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
```
###### Output:

![[absolute.png]]
But if want to position a child element into middle then we can use the `position: absolute` property. An example are given bellwo:
```html
<html>
<head>
<style>
#parent{
height: 400px;
width: 400px;
position: relative;
background-color: red;
}
#child{
height: 50px;
width: 50px;
top: 50%;
right: 50%;
margin-top: -25px;
margin-right: -25px;
position: absolute;
background-color: yellow;
}
</style>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>
<body>
<div id="parent"><div id="child"></div></div>
</body>
</html>
```

Here I add `margin-top: -25px;` and `margin-right: -25px;` for make it fully position in center. Because the div are position after 50% space. But the child div has also height and width. And as the div are not positioned in middle. that's why I move it half of it's width and height.

### Fixed:
---
The positioned fixed element are always same position. 
```css
div.fixed {
  position: fixed;  
  bottom: 0;  
  right: 0;  
  width: 300px;  
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
```

##### Sticky:
---
The `position: sticky` property in CSS allows you to create elements that "stick" to there containing element while scrolling. This means that the element will remain fixed in its position until it reaches the edge of its container, at which point it will scroll with the rest of the content.

```css
p#sticky{
  background-color: gold;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100px;
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```
Here if we want to bottom stick we have to use `bottom: 0`. And we have to use two property for positioning.
