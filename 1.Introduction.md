CSS are using for style Markup. We develop the basic structure of our website using HTML and we design these HTML using CSS. We can use CSS in different way. Like
- Inline.
- Internal.
- External.

I will discuss after a moment. At first I will show you a basic structure of CSS.

A basic syntax of CSS code are given bellow:

```css
h1{
	color:blue;
	font-size: 12px;
}
```

Here,


![[css_basic_syntax.png]]

- **The selector select the HTML element you want to style.**
- **The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.**
- **Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. And the combination of property and value are called CSS rule.**
- **Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.**


The full form of CSS is  Cascading Style Sheets.

![[casecade.png|200x200]]Here you can see a waterfall. The meaning of cascade and waterfall are similar. CSS work quite like this. In CSS, if we define multiple rule then for same element and if there specificity are same then CSS execute the last rule. That's why it named **Cascade**.


An example are given bellow:


```css
h1{
    color: red;
}

h1{
    color: green;
}

h1{
    color: blue;   //this will apply for cascade model.
}
```

### How to add CSS  
---
You know there has three method to add CSS in HTML. They are

#### Inline CSS:
---
In Inline CSS we add all rule using style attribute inside tag. The problem of inline CSS, we have to duplicate code if same design need on two or more times. If we are sure that this design are use only one time then we will use inline CSS. 

```html
<html style="background-color:blue"></html>
```

#### Internal CSS
---

In internal CSS we write all code into head tag using style tag. The advantage of internal CSS is we  can use same design multiple time into the page. We can use the internal CSS if we have to use the same design in multiple time.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<style>
			html{
				background-color: red;
			}
		</style>
	</head>
</html>
```



#### External CSS:
---
Using of external CSS is the best practice in web development. The reason is we can use the same style in multiple page without any kind of duplicate. In we development, most of the time we use the **External CSS** for design our page. In **External CSS** we have to link our CSS with HTML file. If we create the ***index.html***    &   ***style.css*** under the same folder then we can link and add CSS like bellow:

##### HTML:
```html
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

##### CSS:
```css
h1{
    color: red;
}
```
