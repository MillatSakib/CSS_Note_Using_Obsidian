The CSS  `height` and `width` properties are used to set the height and width of an element and the CSS  `max-width` property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

```css
div {
  height: 200px;  
  width: 50%;  
  background-color: powderblue;
}
```

### Minimum and maximum Height and width:
---
```css
div {
  min-height: 200px; /* Sets the minimum height of the div to 200px */
}

```

```css
img {
  max-height: 300px; /* Sets the maximum height of the image to 300px */
}

```

The minimum width and maximum width are similar to minimum height and maximum height.

Using min height and max width we can make a responsive website.The `min-height` and `max-height` properties can be used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes. For example, you could use the `min-height` property to ensure that an element is always visible on a small screen, and the `max-height` property to ensure that the element does not take up too much space on a large screen.

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  div {
    min-height: 300px;
    max-height: 500px;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 601px) {
  div {
    min-height: 400px;
    max-height: 600px;
  }
}
```
