In CSS specificity means which rules are more specific. Like
###### CSS Rule 1:
---
```css
p{
  color: red;
}
```
###### CSS Rule 2:
---
```css
.child{
  color: pink;
}
```

Here what do you think? What rule will get more priority? 
If you think deeply then you can understand that `p` tag are more general than `.child` because we make all paragraph using `<p>` tag. But we can use the `.child` class for select some specific element. That's why the specificity of `.child` are greater than `<p>` tag. So if we use the class `child` inside `<p>` tag then the color of that text will be pink.

There has a sequence of specificity. You can remember it using `IICTU` which denote Inline, Id selector, Class Selector, Tag selector and Universal selector. Where universal selector are more less specific and `inline selector`  are more specific then other selector and it is seqential.

- The `!important` value is 100000
- The `inline` CSS value is 10000
- The `id` selector value is 1000
- The `class` selector value is 100
- The `tag` selector value is 10
- The `universal` selector value is 0.
We write the less specific rule in CSS write first and more specific rules are write after less specific rule. We follow this convention because of if two rules are same and there specificity are same then the rule which are in the last that will applicable.. That's why we add the rules of universal selector at first.
```css
p#color{
  color: white;
  background-color: red;
}
```

Here the specificity are 10+1000=1010.


`Note: Cominator are not affect the specificity.`
