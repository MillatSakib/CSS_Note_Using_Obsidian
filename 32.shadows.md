There are tow type of shadow. Like
- `text-shadaw`
- `box-shadow`
The value of `box-shadow` and `text-shadow` are totally same. If you know about any one value then you can easily use them in any property.

An example are given bellow:
```css
h1{
  text-shadow: 20px 20px 20px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);
}
```

Here we use the `text-shadow` property for make shadow background of text. Here the first value for background shadow for 20px spread since x axis form left to right and the second value for background shadow for 20px spread since y axis from up to down. The third value for make the shadow blur. And we use `rgba` value for make the shadow transparent.

We can add many shadow on a element at a sigle time using comma. An example are given belllwo:
```css
div{
  box-shadow: 20px 20px 20px red, -10px -20px 20px yellow;
}
```

As the box shadow and the text shadow are working at the same process, that's why I don't explain it separately.
