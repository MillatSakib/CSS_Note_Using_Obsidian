In CSS, an outline is a decorative line that is drawn around an element, outside of its border. Outlines are used to make elements stand out or to highlight them for focus. They are also sometimes used to create a visual separation between elements.

- `outline-style`
- `outline-color`
- `outline-width`
- `outline-offset`
- `outline`

### CSS Outline Style

- `dotted` - Defines a dotted outline
- `dashed` - Defines a dashed outline
- `solid` - Defines a solid outline
- `double` - Defines a double outline
- `groove` - Defines a 3D grooved outline
- `ridge` - Defines a 3D ridged outline
- `inset` - Defines a 3D inset outline
- `outset` - Defines a 3D outset outline
- `none` - Defines no outline
- `hidden` - Defines a hidden outline

##### Outline Width:
---
The `outline-width` property specifies the width of the outline.
##### Outline Color:
---
The `outline-color` property is used to set the color of the outline.
##### Outline Offset:
---
The `outline-offset` property adds space between an outline and the edge/border of an element. The space between an element and its outline is transparent.The following example specifies an outline 15px outside the border edge:

#### Outline shorthand:
---
The `outline` property is a shorthand property for setting the following individual outline properties:

- `outline-width`
- `outline-style`
- `outline-color`
The `outline` property is specified as one, two or three values from the list above. The order of the values does not matter.

The following example shows some outlines specified with the shorthand `outline` property:

```css
p{
	outline: dashed;
}
```

```css
p{
	outline: dashed red;
}
```

```css
p{
	outline: 5px dashed red;
}
```
