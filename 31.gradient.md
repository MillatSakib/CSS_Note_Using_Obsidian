There are three type of Gradients in CSS. They are 
- Linear Gradients.
- Radial Gradients
- Conic Gradients
### Linear Gradients:
---
If you want to use linear gradient then you have to define at list two color or you can use more than two color for a smooth transition. The syntax of linear gradient are  `background-color: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...)`.
```css
p{
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red, pink yellow);
}
```

We can use `to top`, `to bottom`, `to left`, `to right`, `to top left`, `to top right`, `to bottom left`, `to bottom right`, `to northwest`, `to northeast`, `to southeast`, `to southwest` or `to top right 45deg` as direction of linear gradient.

We can also repeating gradient color. For this we have to use `repeating-linear-gradient`. An example are given bellow:

```css
#grad{
  background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(red, yellow 10%, green 20%);
}
```


### Radial Gradient: 
---

The full sequence of radial gradient is `background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, color-stops )`.

There are two type of shape of radial gradient. They are :-
- `circle`
- `ellipse` (default)

In radial gradient there use four keyword for define size of radial gradient. They are 
- `farthest-side`
- `closest-side`
- `farthest-corner` (default)
- `closest-corner`

In radial gradient we can use percentage for positioning the starting point. Like (50% 50%). This is the simplest way to define position. The default value are (center center). Which value we can also use are given bellow:
- top
- left
- right
- center
- bottom
- top left
- top right
- bottom left
- bottom right


The full sequence of radial gradient is `background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, color-stops )`. Like 
```css
div{
  background: radial-gradient(circle 50% at 50% 50%, red 0%, yellow 50%, blue 100%);
}


```


If we want to add circular gradient then we can use radial gradient. But there has a few use case of radial gradient. Most of the time we use linear gradient. The syntax of Radial Gradient are given bellow:

```css
div{
  width: 500px;
  height: 300px;
  border: 8px solid rgb(115, 228, 81);
  background-image: radial-gradient(rgb(255, 0, 128), rgb(0, 183, 255));
}
```

We can also use the percentage for more customization. If we set the radius range of then we can use percentage like `background-image: radial-gradient(rgb(255, 0, 128) 20%, rgb(0, 183, 255) 40%)` it. The percentage work procedure are the first rgb color will spread 20% and the second rgb gradient will spread in 40% and then the color trnasition will stop. But here the gradient are like a ellipse. This is default value. But if we want to change it into circle then will add value `circle` at first. 

Now we make a out national flag using radial gradient and circle value:

```css
div{
  width: 800px;
  height: 450px;
  background-image: radial-gradient(circle, rgb(230, 0, 0) 30%, rgb(38, 189, 0) 30%)
}
```

We can set the position of the gradient using `%` or keyword like 
```css
div{
  width: 500px;
  height: 300px;
  background-image: radial-gradient(circle closest-corner at 25% 25%, red 0%, yellow 50%, blue 100%);
}
```

Here we use `closest-corner`  that's why it try to keep it close of the corner in which position.

## Conic Gradient
---
Conic Gradient are use to make gradient into conic. For this we can use like

###### Code:
---
```css
div{
  width: 500px;
  height: 500px;
  margin: auto;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-image: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green);
}
```
###### Output:
![[conic_gradient.png]]



There have the last point and the starting point have not soft mixing. For this we can use the same color in start and end. We can change the starting point using degree
```css
div{
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
  margin: auto;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-image: conic-gradient(from 180deg, red, yellow, green);
}
```

An new example are given bellow:

```css
div{
  background: conic-gradient(from 45deg at 20% 20%, red 0deg 20deg, yellow 90deg 120deg, green 180deg 200deg, blue 270deg);

}
```

If we want to change thhe center than we can use `at 20% 20%` . And we use two deg side by side. We define by it the constant color in this percentage.
