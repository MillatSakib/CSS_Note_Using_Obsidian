 The full meaning of `flex` is flexible. So the flexbox are flexible box. If we apply the `flex` in a container then the block element will contain side by side.
###### Code:
```html
<html>
<head>
<style>
.container{
display: flex;
}
.item{
color: white;
background-color: rgb(192, 42, 192);
font-size: 2rem;
text-align: center;
height: 30vh;
width: 30%;
margin: 5px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="container">
<div class="item one">1</div>
<div class="item two">2</div>
<div class="item three">3</div>
<div class="item four">4</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

The flex container property are are:
- `flex-direction`
- `flex-wrap`
- `flex-flow`
- `justify-content`
- `align-item`
- `align-content`

## `flex-direction`:
---
By default the axis system for flex are

![[default_flex_dir.png]]
In `flex` the element will move through main axis and the element will align through cross axis and the main axis along x axis and cross axis are along y axis. By default the property are `flex-direction: row`. But we can change the flex direction into column using the rule `flex-directin: column`.  If we change the direction the axis change like-

![[flex-direction_col.png]]
We can also use `flex-direction: column-reverse` or `flex-directin: row-reverse`. The screenshot of these are given bellow:

#### Row Reverse

![[row-reverse.png]]

#### Column Reverse:

![[column-reverse.png]]

## `flex-wrap`
---
The value of `flex-wrap` property are 
- `nowrap`
- `wrap`
- `wrap-reverse`
If is not useful `no-wrap` value. Because this is the default value. 
Now wrap property use if you want if the element can't take the appropriate space then it go to the next line of cross axis.

Now you know about the value `wrap-reverse`. This  is quite hard to understand. But if you simulate by customize the code then you can understand this working flow of `wrap-reverse` perfectly. I give an example code bellow:

###### Code: 
```html
<html>
<head>
<style>
.container{
height: 95vh;
border: 10px solid red;
display: flex;
flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
}
.item{
color: white;
background-color: rgb(192, 42, 192);
font-size: 2rem;
text-align: center;
height: 20vh;
width: 20%;
margin: 5px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="container">
<div class="item one">1</div>
<div class="item two">2</div>
<div class="item three">3</div>
<div class="item four">4</div>
<div class="item five">5</div>
<div class="item six">7</div>
<div class="item seven">8</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

## `flex-flow`:
---
The `flex-flow` property are the shorthand of `flex-direction` & `flex-wrap` respectively. You can use it if you prefer the shorthand.
 ```css
 .container{
   flex-flow: row-reverse nowrap;
 }
```

## `justify-content` &  `align-item` :
---
Flexbox is a powerful layout model in CSS that allows for flexible and responsive layouts. Two key properties for aligning items within a flexbox container are:

**justify-content:** This property controls the alignment of items on the **main axis**. The main axis is the primary direction in which flex items are laid out. By default, the main axis is the horizontal axis (left to right). However, if `flex-direction` is set to `column`, the main axis becomes the vertical axis (top to bottom).

**align-items:** This property controls the alignment of items on the **cross axis**. The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis. By default, the cross axis is the vertical axis (top to bottom). However, if `flex-direction` is set to `column`, the cross axis becomes the horizontal axis (left to right).

Here are the different values available for each property and their effects:

**justify-content:**

- `flex-start`: Items are aligned at the beginning of the main axis.
- `flex-end`: Items are aligned at the end of the main axis.
- `center`: Items are centered on the main axis.
- `space-between`: Items are evenly spaced with the remaining space distributed on both ends.
- `space-around`: Items are evenly spaced with equal space between each item and the edges of the container.

**align-items:**

- `flex-start`: Items are aligned at the beginning of the cross axis.
- `flex-end`: Items are aligned at the end of the cross axis.
- `center`: Items are centered on the cross axis.
- `stretch`: Items are stretched to fill the entire available space on the cross axis.
- `baseline`: Items are aligned along the baseline of their text.

## Flex item properties
---
## `order`:

By default the value of `order` are 0 of all element & as the default value of `order` are same so all the element are take it's position by order of Html element. But if we set the value of the element of these element then we can change it's order. So let's go how we can use the order property in flex item.

```html
<html>
<head>
<style>
.container{
  display: flex;
  height: 95vh;
  border: 10px solid red;
}
.item{
color: white;
background-color: rgb(192, 42, 192);
font-size: 2rem;
text-align: center;
height: 20vh;
width: 20%;
margin: 5px;
}
.one{
  order: 1;
}
.three{
  order: 2;
}
.five{
  order: 2;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
     <div class="item one">1</div>
     <div class="item two">2</div>
     <div class="item three">3</div>
     <div class="item four">4</div>
     <div class="item five">5</div>
     <div class="item six">7</div>
     <div class="item seven">8</div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Here as the class `one` `three` `five` value of `order` is greater then then other element will place at first. Then the class `one` `three` `five`  will take space respectively. 

### `flex-grow`:
---
When we use wrap content then if the element can't in the same line then the element go to the next line. But sometime the element can't not take the full space of screen because of the element which go to the next line that quite larger than the space. That's why the space are not used. Using the `flex-grow` we can solve this type of problem. If we use the `flex-grow` property then if some space are in not used then the element grow automatically for take full screen. By default the value of `flex` grow property are `0`.  If we want flex grow then we can use the `flex-grow: 1`  rule. 
```html
<html>
<head>
<style>
.container{
height: 95vh;
border: 10px solid red;
display: flex;
flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;
}
.item{
color: white;
background-color: rgb(192, 42, 192);
font-size: 2rem;
text-align: center;
height: 20vh;
width: 20%;
margin: 5px;
flex-grow: 1;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="container">
<div class="item one">1</div>
<div class="item two">2</div>
<div class="item three">3</div>
<div class="item four">4</div>
<div class="item five">5</div>
<div class="item six">7</div>
<div class="item seven">8</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

### `flex-shrink`:
---
We can use `flex-shrink` if we don't want if all the content can't contain in the first row of the screen. By default the value of `flex-shrink` is `1`. But we can change it into `1`. But I think in most of the case the the default value of `flex-shrink` must not be changed. If we write the same code then we have add just the code bellow:
```css
.item{
   flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

### `flex-basis`:
---
The `flex-basis` are use to make a more flexible system instead of width.  It maintain `min-width`, `max-width` and `with` at a time. In flex system the use `flex-bas`  is the good choose instead of using width.
```css
.item{
  flex-basis: 200;
}
```

## `flex`(shorthand)
---
In flex shorthand there include `flex-grow` `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis` . The structure are `flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis`
