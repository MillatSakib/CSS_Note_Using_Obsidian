If you learn previous chapter of  CSS perfectly you can decorate a link like this easily. But Now we will learn about Links decoration in CSS deeply.

The four links states are:
**link:** A normal, unvisited link
**Visited:** a link the user has visited
**hover:** a link when the user mouses over it
**active:** a link the moment it is clicked

```css
/* unvisited link */  
a:link {  color: red;}  
  
/* visited link */  
a:visited {  color: green;}  
  
/* mouse over link */  
a:hover {  color: hotpink;}  
  
/* selected link */  
a:active {  color: blue;}
```

Here normally the link will show red. If you visit the link then it will be green. And you hover it then will show hotpink . And at last when the link under click then the link show blue color. If you want to change the decoration
