The `overflow` property are use to control what will happens to content that is too big to fit into an area. The overflow property has the following values:
- `visiable`: This is default value. In the other word if we don't use any overflow property then it apply implicitly.
- `hidden`: If the content are overflow then it will be hidden if we use this porperty.
- `scroll`: If we use scroll property then scrollbar will add in side.
- `auto`: This is similar to the scroll, it acts dynamically. If the scrollbar needed then the scrollbar are added.
### `overflow: visiable`
---
I say it that it is default value. If the content can't contain in the container then the content will go outside.
###### Code:
---
```html
<div>You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.
</div>
```

```css
div {
width: 200px;
height: 65px;
background-color: coral;
overflow: visible;
}
```

###### Output:
---

### `overflow: hidden`
---
With the `hidden` value, the overflow content will hide form container. 
###### Code:
---
```html
<div>You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.
</div>
```

```css
div {
width: 200px;
height: 65px;
background-color: coral;
overflow: hidden;
}
```

###### Output:
---
![[overflow_hidden.png]]

### `overflow: scroll`
---
If we add the `overflow: scroll` property in CSS then a scrollbar will add side of the content. If the content are also are not go to outside then the scrollbar even so appear
###### Code:
---
```html
<div>You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.
</div>
```

```css
div {
width: 200px;
height: 65px;
background-color: coral;
overflow: scroll;
}
```

###### Output:
![[overflow_scroll.png]]

### `overflow: auto`
---
The `auto` value is similar to scroll property. But if the scroll are needed then we can get scrollbar. Otherwise we can't get scrollbar.

```css
div {
width: 200px;
height: 65px;
background-color: coral;
overflow: auto;
}
```
