Like others programming language we can comment a message. CSS comment are not displayed in browser but it help us to read the code and understand the logic. To write  clean and readable code comments are crucial. In CSS there has two type of comment. Likes:-
- Single line comment.
- Multiple line comment.
Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date. For single line comment we can use double slash symbol(// ) and for multiple line comment we have to use (/* */) for comment. 

### Example 1:
```css
p{
	color: red; //this is single line commnet
}
```

### Example 2:

```css
p{
	color: green;
	/*
	Here I write a Multiple line comment.
	We can use new line by this comment system.
	*/
}
```
