The CSS `box-sizing` property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.
When we add the padding and border then it take extra space outside the box element. But it is too much tough to calculate all time sum of the pixel. Here the solve is `box-sizing` property. If we use the `box-sizing: border-box;` then the padding and border are take space from box space.

```css
div{
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
