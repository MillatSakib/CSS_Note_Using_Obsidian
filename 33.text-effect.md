Here we will learn about 
- `text-overflow`
- `word-wrap`
- `word-break`

### `text-overflow`:
---
The `text-overflow` property are specifies how the overflow content will display.An example are given bellow:
###### Code:
---
```html
<html>
<head>
<style>
div{
  height: 16px;
  width: 70px;
  margin: auto;
  text-align: center;
  border: 2px solid black;
  /*These three property need to add*/
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <div>Amar sonar bangla ami tomay valobasi</div>
</body>
</html>
```

###### Output:
---

### `word-wrapping`:
---
Sometimes a word can be so much long and it can go out of the box. The `word-wrap` property allow long word and it will break the line the word overflow. For this you just add the rule `word-wrap: break-word;`
```css
p{
  word-wrap: break-word;
}
```


### `word-break`
---
The `word-break` property specifies line breaking rules. There are some value of `word-break` property. They are:-

-  **normal:** Default behavior. Breaks words at natural language break points (spaces, hyphens, etc.). Words won't break in the middle if they don't fit within a line.
- **break-all:** Allows words to break at any point, even in the middle, to avoid overflow. Useful for long URLs or very narrow containers.
- **keep-all:** Prevents word breaks within the element. Long words might overflow the container. Often used with CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) text, which doesn't use spaces between words.
- **break-word:** Similar to `break-all`, but only breaks words with hyphens at appropriate hyphenation points. More natural for languages that use hyphenation.

```css
.long-url {
  word-break: break-all;
}

.no-breaks {
  word-break: keep-all;
}

.hyphenated-text {
  word-break: break-word;
}

```
