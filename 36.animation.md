In CSS we can make a animation without using Javascript. For these we have to use `animation` property in that element and we have to add all rule under `@keyframes`. An example are given bellow:
```css
div{
height: 400px;
width: 400px;
margin: 100px auto;
background-color: red;
animation-name: example;
animation-duration:4s;
}

  

@keyframes example {

  from {
    background-color: red;
	}

  to {
    background-color: yellow;
    }
}
```

Here you see in animation we just define the first and last destination. In different type of situation we have to use the percentage like bellow:
```css
@keyframes example {
  0% {
      background-color: red;
     }
  25% {
        background-color: yellow;
      }
  50% {
		background-color: blue;
	  }
  100% {
         background-color: green;
       }
}

div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
}
```

There has some property of animation. They are:
- `animation-name`
- `animation-duration`
- `animation-delay`
- `animation-iteration-count`
- `animation-direction`
- `animation-timing-function`
- `animation-fill-mode`

`animation-name:` By animation name we select the animation which name are written after `@keyframes`. 
```css
div{
  animation-name: example;
}
```

`animation-duration:` By animation duration we define how much time take to appear change. We define the value of `animation-duration` in second.
```css
div{
  animation-duration: 4s;
}
```

`animation-delay:` By `animation-delay` we define after how long time the animation will start. We can also define the `animation-delay` in negative second. But if we use the negative timing then the animation will start after that equal time of `animation-duration`. Because the time has expand before start. 

```css
div{
  animation-delay: 2s;
}
```

`animation-iteration-cont`: By this property we can define the repeating times of the animation. We can specify it in number of if we want it repeat infinite time then we can add the value as `infinite`
```css
div{
  animation-name: example;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
}
```

`animation-direction`:  The `animation-direction` property specifies an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles. The animation-direction property can have the following values:
- `normal`: The animation are play as normal. This is default value.
- `reverse`: The animation is played in reverse direction.
- `alternate`: The animation is forwards first then backwards.
- `alternate-reverse`: The animation is backward firs then forwards.

`animation-time-function`:  The `animation-timing-function` property specifies the speed curve of the animation. In this property there have can have the value bellow
- `ease` - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
- `linear` - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
- `ease-in` - Specifies an animation with a slow start
- `ease-out` - Specifies an animation with a slow end
- `ease-in-out` - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end

`animation-fill-mode:` The `animation-fill-mode` are use to specify the property which will show before and after  animation. If we don't define property into the element selector then the element will disapear after playing the animation. That's why to make the visiable the element after animation then we have to set the value of `animation-fill-mode`. The value of `animation-fill-mode` have the value:
- `none`: This is default value. If we don't add the property of that element then it will be vanish
- `forwards`: This will apply the value which value are use in last percentage.
- `backwards`:: This will apply the value which value are use in first percentage.
- `both`: If we use the value as  `both` then the initial rule will  set which in 0% and the last value is that value which we give the last percentage.

## `animation` (shorthand):
---
The animation shorthand are given bellow:
```css
div{
/*animation: animation-name animation-duration animation-timing-function animation-delay animation-iterarion-count animation-direction*/
  animation: example 5s linear 2s infinite alternate;
}
```
