Some time we use the image which should be take dynamic pixel. But if the aspect ratio of the pixel are not match then the image will must be pixel out. For fix this problem we can use the `object-fit` property in CSS. The value of `object-fit` can be `contain`, `cover`, `fill`, `none`, `scale-down`. The default value of `object-fit` is `none`. Actually the `object-fit` property in CSS is used to specify how an element's content should be resized to fit its container.

In a word, the `object-fit` property defines how the content of replaced element such as `img` or `video` should be resized to fit its container.


### `object-fit: contain`:
In this case the image be resized to fit the aspect ratio of it's container. If the image's aspect ratio doesn't match the container's, it can't take full space to left-right or top-bottom side. An example are given bellow:

![[object-fit-contain.png]]

### `object-fit: cover`:

Here, the images will resize or another word the image will be zoom in or zoom out to take the full space of container. An example image are given bellow for clearence:

![[object-fit-cover.png]]

### `object-fit: fill`:

If we use the rule `object-fit: fill` then the image will be resized to fit the aspect ratio of it's container. An if the aspect ratio of the image are miss match with the aspect ratio of the container then the image will be stretched. An example image are given bellow:

![[object-fit-fill.png]]

### `object-fit: none;`

In this case the image won't be resized at all. In another word The image will not either stracthed or squeezed according to their container. It will show only that part of image which can contain inside container.
![[object-fit-none.png]]

An Example of code of `object-fit` property are given bellow:

```css
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <style>
        img {
            height: 512px;
            width: 512px;
            border: 2px solid red;
            object-fit: none;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
<div>
    <img src="./love_sun.jpg">
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### `object-position`:
The `object-position` property use to where the image will start  after using the `object-fit` property. The value we can use `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom` or we can use percentage. 
```css
img{
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  border: 2px solid red;
  object-fit: fill;
  object-position: top left;
}
```

### `background-size:`

`background-size` are quite same `object-position`. But the the `object-position` are use for image. And `background-size` are use to resize background image. The value can be auto, contain and cover.

```css
div{
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  border: 2px solid red;
  background-size: cover;
}
```
